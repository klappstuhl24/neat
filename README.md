# NEAT Project

Welcome to the NEAT Project! This repository implements (a slightly simplified version of) NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a genetic algorithm for evolving artificial neural networks.

## Features

- Implementation of the NEAT algorithm.
- Customizable hyperparameters and usage of different Environments
- Example usage provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository and:
    ```bash 
    cd NEAT_Project
    ```

2. Create a new Conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda create -n neat-project python=3.12
    ```

3. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate neat-project
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `example_usage.ipynb` Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook example_usage.ipynb
    ```
    or open in an IDE, for example VS Code.

2. Read the provided information in the notebook.

3. Run the first code cell.

4. Choose the environment and hyperparameters as desired.

That's it! You're ready to explore the power of NEAT! Feel free to do adjustments, changes and improvements!

Also please report any bugs or errors.
